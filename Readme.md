# Weebo-OS the GitOps way

## Goal

- Replace Omarchy by Weebo-OS
- Discover and deepdive the handling of dotfile
- Create a tekton pipeline to build/handle this project to make sure that if github goes even more nuts i can switch to my own git
- Try different tiling manager, Hyprland has my love for the past month but i need to check other tiling manager
- Try Distrobox in a no root way !
- Keep the TUI first approach but make sure that all the tools are properly added to the doc
- VsCode and LazyVim are good !
- Look at [ToolBox](https://containertoolbx.org/) from Fedora
